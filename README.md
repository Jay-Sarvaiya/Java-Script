Collection of all the Java Script (JS) mini-projects/scripts.

## 1) Animated Card: 
In the animated card, the card which is made using html and css flips as we hover over mouse over it. It is made using html, css and js.

## 2) Typewriting Effect:
In the typewriting effect, I have made an animation which makes the word display itself letter-by-letter and not all of a sudden. It is also made using html, css and js.
